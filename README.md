A Python library implementing a `dict`-like object that writes to a file as it is modified

![Demo gif](http://i.imgur.com/yaXzzjG.gif)

`livejson` is:

- **Easy**: use `livejson` with the same interface as Python `list`s and `dict`s, meaning it can basically be used as a drop-in replacement.
- **Flexible**: `livejson` fully supports complex nestings of `list`s and `dict`s, meaning it can represent any valid JSON file.
- **Compatible**: `livejson` works perfectly on both Python 2 and Python 3.
- **Lightweight**: `livejson` is a single file with no external dependencies. Just install and go!
- **Reliable**: by default, no caching is used. Every single time you access a `livejson.Database`, it's read straight from the file. And every time you write to it, the change is instant. No delays, no conflicts. However, if efficiency is important, you can use the context manager to perfomrm "grouped writes", which allow for performing a large number of operations with only one write at the end.
- **100% test covered** Yay ðŸŽ‰

`livejson` can be used for:

- **Database storage**: you can use `livejson` to easily write flexible JSON databases, without having to worry about complex `open` and `close` operations, or learning how to use the `json` module.
- **Debugging**: You can use `livejson` to back up your Python objects. If you use a `livejson.Database` instead of a `dict` or a `list` and your script crashes you'll still  have a hard copy of your object. And you barely had to change any of your code.
- **General-purpose JSON**: If your script or application needs to interact with JSON files in any way, consider using `livejson`, for simplicity's sake. `livejson` can make your code easier to read and understand, and also save you time.

## Installing
`livejson` supports both Python 2 and 3, and can be easily installed with `pip`.
```bash
# Python 2
sudo pip install livejson
# Python 3
sudo pip3 install livejson
```
After installing, you can just `import livejson` from your code!

## Example usage
Creating a new database:
```python
>>> import livejson
>>> my_db = livejson.Database("test.json")
>>> my_db["dogs"] = "cats"
>>> with open("test.json", "r") as f:
...     print(f.read())
...
{"dogs": "cats"}
>>> my_db["dogs"]
'cats'
```
Reading and modifying an existing database:
```python
>>> my_db = livejson.Database("test.json")
>>> my_db["dogs"]
u'cats'
>>> my_db["dogs"] = "fish"
>>> with open("test.json", "r") as f:
...     print(f.read())
...
{"dogs": "fish"}
>>>
```
